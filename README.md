Welcome to the **X-Code Projects** repository! This directory contains a collection of simple iOS applications developed using **Swift** and built with **Xcode**. Each project explores key concepts of iOS development, including user interface design with **Auto Layout**, basic app structures, and learning Swift programming techniques.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Auto Layout Dicee**
A simple iOS app that uses **Auto Layout** to create a dice rolling app. The layout adjusts based on different screen sizes and orientations.

- **Features**:
  - Dice images that change randomly on tap.
  - Designed using Auto Layout for responsive UI.
  
### 2. **Calculator Layout App**
A Swift app designed to replicate a basic calculator interface using **Auto Layout** for positioning buttons and labels.

- **Features**:
  - Calculator functionality for simple arithmetic operations.
  - Responsive design using Auto Layout.

### 3. **I Am Rich App**
A simple app that displays a wealth theme. It's built as a learning project to explore Swift syntax and basic UI design.

- **Features**:
  - Displays a “rich” theme with an image and a label.
  - Focuses on basic UI elements and Swift syntax.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift**: The primary programming language used for all iOS app development.
- **Xcode**: The integrated development environment (IDE) for building iOS apps.
- **Auto Layout**: For designing flexible, responsive user interfaces.
- **UIKit**: Framework for building graphical user interfaces on iOS.

## Getting Started
